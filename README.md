# vc_kenya
Codes to recreate simulations aimed to describe the relative importance of dengue transmission through vectorial capacity of household versus non-household environments in two Kenyan populations.

File VC_source contains the codes to load datasets, functions and relevant information to run simulations. 

Once the information is loaded, codes to run simulations can be found in file VC_sims. Simulations comprises 1) m values and their distribution, 2) Vectorial Capacity along a temperature range and 3) Vectorial capacity in time considering the temperature. All simulations considers both Household and Non-Household environments for both Kenyan cities: Kisumu and Ukunda.

In addition, simulations of vectorial capacity along a temperature range varying proportion of humans in non-household environments are included in the file VC_sims.

The remaining files (R01RenewalClimateDat_DATA_2022-08-16_0928.csv, n_containers.csv and prop_imm_time.csv) are datasets containing data that are loaded with VC_source and are needed for simulations.
